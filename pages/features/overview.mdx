9. Move over to the “Authentications” subtab and inside the “Authentications count” chart, filter out “authentication_failure” by hovering over the legend and clicking on "Filter out value" button. This should populate counts for “authentication_success” alone.

10. Scroll up to the top and notice the new filter that has the label "Not event.outcome: failure" Now click the filter and click on "Include results". This should invert the filter and show counts for “authentication_failure” alone.

11. Click back on the Hosts tab and delete the filter with the label "Not event.outcome: failure". Let’s now explore the “Uncommon processes” subtab. The functionalities offered by individual elements are pretty much the same.

12. Finally click on the “Events” tab. The histogram works similar to the one found in the authentications tab. You can use the crosshair to zone in on a timeframe and click on the legends to filter out categories.
